# Pulsar Testbed

Apache Pulsar is a real-time messaging and event streaming platform used to handle stable and scalable data flow in large-scale distributed systems. Pulsar is developed as an Apache Software Foundation project and provides various features for distributed messaging systems and event stream processing.

Pulsar operates based on the Pub-Sub messaging pattern (publish-subscribe). Producers publish messages to topics, and consumers subscribe to these topics to receive messages. This Pub-Sub model is useful for building message-based applications and event-driven architectures.
